# serena

Project Serena is a Java-based command interpreter (and a purely personal project) 
that aims to automate manual tasks performed on the computer, such as typing, 
clicking, moving the mouse, and others.

Its clear and natural syntax, combined with the possibilities of programming languages 
​​such as loops and functions, brings ordinary users closer to technical programmers.

With Serena, you can execute the following list of commands:
* EXECUTE: executes a computer program. Requires either the path to the program's binaries or its executable terminal command;
* MOVE_MOUSE x,y: moves the mouse pointer to an arbitrary x,y position, e.g. MOVE_MOUSE 200,300;
